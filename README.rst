Image Classification
====================

**This cross-platform app was generated by** `Briefcase`_ **- part of**
`The BeeWare Project`_.

image_classifier.py was taken from the `TensorFlow examples repository
<https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/1e624527d2fea0333894156ad7a59d8d455b2c73/lite/examples/image_classification/raspberry_pi>`__,
and the .tflite model file was downloaded using the setup.sh script which can be found
there.
